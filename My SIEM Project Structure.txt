***IMPLEMENTATION NOTES****

Data Sources: The code includes placeholders for Windows Event Logs, firewall logs, and IDS/IPS alerts. In a real implementation, you would use appropriate libraries to collect these logs.

Machine Learning: The anomaly detection uses Isolation Forest, but you could extend this with more sophisticated models.

GUI: The Flask-based web interface provides a dashboard, but you could extend it with more detailed views and controls.

Correlation Rules: The correlation engine looks for patterns across multiple events.

Alerting: Supports email and Slack notifications.

Scalability: For large deployments, consider using a message queue (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) for log processing.

To run this SIEM tool:

Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the directory structure

To Run: python app.py
